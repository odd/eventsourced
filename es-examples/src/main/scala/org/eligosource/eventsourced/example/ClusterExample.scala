/**
 * Manages a cluster-wide `Door` singleton. `Door` is a finite state machine (FSM)
 * taken from `FsmSpec`. `NodeActor` listens to cluster events. If it becomes
 * the leader it creates the `Door` instance, otherwise, it obtains a remote `Door`
 * reference from the other leader. Door commands ("open" or "close") received by
 * `NodeActor` are forwarded as event messages to the door singleton.
 *
 * If the JVM of the leader crashes, another `NodeActor` will be determined to be
 * the new leader. The new leader re-creates the `Door` instance and recovers its
 * state by replaying journaled event messages. All other `NodeActor`s update their
 * remote references.
 *
 * @param selfAddress address of the cluster node this actor is running on.
